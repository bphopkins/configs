# TODO List

- [x] Configure markdown-tasks.lua(s) to handle all of the following:
    - mt - toggle `[ ]/[x]`
    - md - toggle marked done
    - ms - toggle marked started
    - mD - toggle both `[ ]/[x]` and done
- [x] Configure markdown_tasks.lua(s) to either (a) generate a TASKS.md file with all open tasks in a directory, or (b) write a bash script/function that accomplishes the same thing. @done(2025-11-25 09:16)
- [x] Initialize `~/.bash.d` directory and split up aliases and functions. @done(2025-11-24 21:28)
- [ ] Update Neovim README when the dust settles
